<?php include("../Isaacs_Movies/ReviewStructure/mid1.php");?>
                    Johnny Depp gives an amazing performance as Rango, a stranger lost in the desert and thirsty for water.<br>
                    <br>
                    The visual design of this movie is incredible, just the sight of the desert makes my mouth feel dry. The striking yet alluring visuals make it a very unique childrens movie.<br>
                    The characters are all relatable, yet zany and mad.<br>
                    Rattlesnake Jake is one of the most well designed and coolest looking bad guys in the world ever.<br>
                    Rango was one of my favourite movies growing up, and it still holds a special place in my heart. This is rightfully so, as the movie is very good.<br>
