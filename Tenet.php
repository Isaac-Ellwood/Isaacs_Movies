                    Tenet is one of my favourite movies.<br>
                    <br>
                    The movie`s strange pacing, along with its cumbersome length results in a unique, though not unwelcoming viewing experience. Tenet does not take any breaks, and never feels dull. The action sequences are well crafted, and I couldn’t help but look on in awe as the plot unfolded. All story elements wove together to form a wonderful movie, accompanied by an incredible soundtrack, by composer Ludwig Göransson.<br>
                    The soundtrack suits the different moods, and really enhances the vibe.<br>
