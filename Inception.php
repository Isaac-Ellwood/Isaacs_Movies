                    The plot of this movie is very cool, and also kinda confusing.<br>
                    The movie was emotional and philosophical. The “mind heist” is extremely high in stakes and requires absolute precision and planning. This movie is masterfully crafted, and I greatly enjoyed watching it.<br>
                    The soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, is one of the best that I have ever heard.<br>
