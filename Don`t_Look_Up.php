                    A lot of good actors in one mediocre movie.<br>
                    <br>
                    Don’t get me wrong, I certainly did not dislike Don’t Look Up. However I think that for such a high value, big hype production, it kinda under delivered.<br>
                    The movie kept me invested and entertained, and the main characters were relatable. The metaphor for climate change was glaringly obvious, which didn`t subtract from the plot but rather made me more aware while watching that the movie felt like it had something to prove.<br>
                    Overall it was pretty okay. I am a big Leonardo Di Caprio fan.<br>
