                    <h1>Baby Driver</h1>
<?php include("../Isaacs_Movies/ReviewStructure/mid1.php");?>
                    Baby Driver follows Baby, a driving prodigy with tinnitus who has turned to a life of crime to repay his debt. The stakes are high and the plot is engaging.<br>
                    All action sequences are beautifully shot, 
                    As the movie progresses, Baby must navigate a new relationship whilst avoiding certain death.<br>
                    I highly recommend this movie to all.<br>
