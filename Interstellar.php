<?php include("../Isaacs_Movies/ReviewStructure/mid1.php");?>
                    Interstellar plays with the concepts of space and time, at the end even going beyond the third dimension. Time passes at different speeds on different planets, weather is unknown. The other worlds truly feel unkempt, alien. An emotional rollercoaster ensues as our heroes desperately try to find a planet suitable for human life. The fate of many hangs in the balance.<br>
                    The soundtrack is critically acclaimed, and for good reason. Hans Zimmer once again delivered on one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.<br>
                    An overall amazing movie.<br>
