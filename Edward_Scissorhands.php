                    The aesthetics in the movie are rather good, a stark contrast between the dark castle on the hill and the welcoming, pastel town below.<br>
                    I enjoyed the characters, and the way their relationships grew during the movie.<br>
                    The movie was a good watch, not one of my favourites but still fairly decent. However I did dislike the end of the movie. It was cliche and uninteresting.<br>
