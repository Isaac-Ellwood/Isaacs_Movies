                    A classic kiwi comedy.<br>

                    A genuinely funny movie, Hunt for the Wilderpeople succeeds in everything it sets out to be. I was hooked from beginning to end. The movie was oddly heartwarming, telling the story of a foster son and father living, running and growing closer in the bush.<br>
                    The soundtrack was great at capturing the mood of the movie at all times.<br>
