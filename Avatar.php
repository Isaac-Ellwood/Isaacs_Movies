                    Avatar is the highest grossing film of all time, though not many hold it in such high regard anymore.<br>
                    <br>
                    In my opinion, relative to Avatar`s success, the movie has fallen into obscurity. However, as four new Avatar films are set to release soon, The movie is stepping back into the spotlight. I thought it would only be appropriate to review this movie.<br>
                    I enjoyed the movie. The characters and world seemed well fleshed out, and I was invested in the story all the way through. The stakes were high and the battles were fought fiercely.<br>
                    The scenery and CGI in this movie are what really made it stand out among movies of its time, and it holds up against CGI nowadays extremely well. The world of pandora really seems to be living and breathing, as if I can sense its heartbeat through the screen.<br>
                    Avatar is an all round great movie.<br>
