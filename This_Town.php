                    Admittedly, I am a tad biased towards this movie.<br>
                    <br>
                    However I think this movie is pretty good. The comedy is authentically kiwi, with a decent story which keeps the audience guessing. I had a good time watching the movie, and enjoyed a few laughs.<br>
                    The soundtrack was made by the NZ band Moniker, having worked on soundtracks for movies such as Eagle vs Shark and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. The music adds a nice atmosphere, which ties together the movie well.<br>
