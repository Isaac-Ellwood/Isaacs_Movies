<?php include("../Isaacs_Movies/ReviewStructure/mid1.php");?>
                    A classic heist movie.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ocean`s Eleven ticks all the boxes. The actors all play their respective roles well, the plot is well paced and executed. Matt Damon is in it. And it is well rounded out with a nice twist ending.<br>
                    The soundtrack is groovy and suspenseful. It fits the vibe well. Overall it all works great together.<br>
                    A genre defining masterpiece.<br>
